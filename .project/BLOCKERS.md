# NEXOLAB Blockers

Updated: 2026-08-26

## Issue #189 — actual-host recovery acceptance

Blocked on critical defect #683. The first approved source→packaged transition created its PostgreSQL backup, then failed after partial central recreation because repo-relative local-auth host paths were re-resolved under the relocated package catalog. Source central, Dashboard and edge runtime were restored; all six named-volume identities were preserved and telemetry resumed advancing. Resume #189 only after #683 merges, a new ARM64/local-auth artifact passes acceptance and that artifact is re-staged. Power-loss remains separately gated.

## Issue #683 — local-auth relocation and full source recovery

Active critical bugfix. Required outcome: canonical external local-auth host paths before mutation, direct-installer fail-fast, and full source-central + Dashboard recovery after post-mutation failure without secret packaging or volume deletion.

## Issue #200 — physical RS-485 topology

Passive evidence confirms one CP2104 adapter and one current production bus. Full acceptance still requires physical topology inspection and/or the intended second isolated adapter. Unit 115, duplicate IDs, termination, biasing, shielding and grounding remain unverified.

## Issue #201 — LE-01MP cumulative energy

Normal-operation semantics are accepted. Controlled restart/power-cycle discontinuity evidence remains pending; an unplanned hard reset cannot be reclassified as approved evidence.

## Issue #202 — XJP60D portability

Representative KK1/KK2 physical evidence, Unit 115 resolution and extended semantics still require real hardware evidence. Unconfirmed fields remain unmapped.

## Issue #585 — W2 / Unit 201 handback

Blocked until the Product Owner confirms the temporary external RS-485 owner has released W2 and approves any required physical handback/reconnection.

## Security maintenance — CVE-2026-14456

Four exact reviewed HIGH/no-fix decisions are retained through **2026-08-30**. Rebuild/review at expiry or earlier if a fixed Trixie package appears, findings disappear, QUIC reachability changes or severity becomes Critical.

## Cleared boundaries

- #444 LOCAL_LAN user administration — completed.
- #646 main branch protection — completed; `main` requires `NEXOLAB Merge Gate`.
- #667 CVE lifecycle date reconciliation — completed and merged.
- #245 standalone offline Raspberry Pi acceptance — completed on real hardware.
- #673 production-readiness state reconciliation — completed and merged.
- #675 source-to-packaged authority tooling — completed with exact-head review and required GREEN workflows.
- #679 ARM64 QEMU package acceptance — completed with GREEN post-merge ARM64/local-auth run `32832798392` and independently verified artifact/provenance.

## Safety boundaries

No blocker may be bypassed by Modbus/controller write, hardware write, production/site cutover without approval, persistent-data deletion, named-volume deletion, secret exposure or mandatory cloud dependency.

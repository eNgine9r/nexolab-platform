# NEXOLAB Current State

Updated: 2026-08-19

## Repository and runtime baseline

Accepted product-code baseline on `main` is `62e94ea02b2f4c7da03d1a5fa11cc1e24459f6f7`, the squash merge of PR #602 — **feat: migrate Energy history to canonical chart system**. State-only reconciliation commits may advance repository HEAD without changing this accepted product baseline; use GitHub `main` for the exact repository HEAD.

The Raspberry Pi source runtime remains deployed at `7a19f53950492a40255c53b1d2018bbdff9466e2`. The persisted local AcquisitionRegistry remains revision 8 with `le01mp-201` intentionally `disabled` while W2 is externally owned. No source deployment was performed by Issues #584 or #586.

## Issue #584 — complete

Temporary Unit 201 exclusion is complete and verified on the real Raspberry Pi. Evidence remains `runtime/deployments/issue-584-20260818T185455Z`.

## Issue #585 — blocked restoration lane

Do not restore Unit 201 until the Product Owner confirms that the external controller no longer owns W2 and explicitly approves any required physical handback. The 2026-08-21 through 2026-08-23 review window is not authorization by itself.

## Issue #586 — complete

Issue #586 is closed `status:done`. PR #592 merged GREEN as `75c6f5471d77d781b124fbd40c33ba924aec26f8`.

Real Raspberry Pi browser-closed evidence proved the acquisition and persistence planes are independent of browser lifetime:

- 60 sampled checks observed zero established browser/API connections on ports 3000/8081/8082;
- AcquisitionRegistry remained `8 -> 8`;
- Device Agent `normal.physical_requests_total` advanced `5049 -> 5392` (`+343`);
- PostgreSQL `telemetry_samples` advanced `4,665,493 -> 4,665,722` (`+229`);
- newest persisted `captured_at` advanced from `2026-08-18 19:18:52.033946+00` to `2026-08-18 19:20:28.276628+00`.

Evidence: `runtime/deployments/issue-586-browser-closed-20260818T191852Z`.

The merged repair now provides:

- one canonical complete-history loader with stable `snapshot_at`, captured-time pagination and event deduplication;
- Live Data reuse of that canonical loader;
- complete persisted Overview bootstrap instead of a single `limit=1000` page;
- deterministic buffered history-to-live reconciliation;
- duplicate and out-of-order tail rejection;
- preservation of newer non-valid samples for truthful Chart System gaps;
- no duplicate route-local latest buffer appended after reconciliation.

Final PR #592 gates on head `6ef7c65b1e0838e75ebaff60d85881f4718cd7c7`:

- Core CI `32179697028`: PASS;
- Authenticated Dashboard Acceptance `32179696964`: PASS;
- Offline Bundle `32179696933`: PASS.

No backend schema, acquisition scheduler, physical polling cadence, dependency graph, Modbus behavior or hardware configuration changed in #586.

## Issue #594 — complete

The Product Owner explicitly authorized provisioning a dedicated read-only LOCAL_LAN identity for the MCP gateway. The account `nexolab-mcp` is active under the supported `laboratory_technician` product role with exactly two explicit grants: `telemetry.read` and `nodes.read`. The password was generated outside Git, was never printed or committed, and remains in a mode-600 local secret file pending any separately approved persistent deployment.

Real Raspberry Pi acceptance on `nexolab-edge-01` proved:

- MCP modern protocol negotiation `2026-07-28`;
- exactly six approved tools, all read-only/non-destructive;
- real `system_health`, node list, node status, latest telemetry, bounded history and active-alarm calls PASS;
- local-session access-token refresh PASS and rotated the access token;
- Device Agent remained healthy and Telemetry API/database/MQTT remained ready with queue depth 0;
- the ephemeral acceptance container was removed and port 8787 returned free;
- no Modbus write, hardware write, site exposure or persistent MCP service enablement occurred.

PR #593 merged GREEN as `b46e518f8769f83ba22c608bacd5a368776e1701` and Issue #594 is closed `status:done`. Persistent systemd enablement, external tunnel/reverse-proxy exposure and production credential relocation remain a separate cutover decision.

## Issue #598 — container supply-chain baseline restored

Issue #598 is closed `status:done`. PR #599 merged GREEN as `b25ae18e196eb84fc56ae951003d0820a22dc579`.

A fresh Container Supply Chain scan surfaced HIGH `CVE-2026-14456` in Debian 13 OpenSSL packages used by Device Agent and telemetry-service. Debian describes the affected path as an OpenSSL QUIC server listener pending-connection exhaustion path. Repository/runtime audit proved neither NEXOLAB image creates a QUIC/HTTP3 listener or accepts QUIC Initial packets.

The repository's existing HIGH/no-fix policy was used without weakening global gates: four exact image/package/CVE decisions were added, owned by `platform-security`, expiring **2026-08-26**. Wildcards, Critical exceptions, `ignore-unfixed`, dependency changes and runtime changes remain forbidden.

Exact PR #599 gates:

- Core CI `32219771902`: PASS;
- Telemetry Service `32219771893`: PASS;
- Container Supply Chain `32219772068`: PASS.

No application runtime, dependency version, database, deployment, Modbus or hardware behavior changed.

## Issue #587 — complete

Issue #587 is closed `status:done`. PR #597 merged GREEN as `84584640246f8985c0c303654def99365c8458c4`.

Saved Live Dashboards now provide view-only `1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `7d`, `30d` and timezone-aware Custom ranges using the canonical complete persisted-history loader from #586. One stable snapshot boundary is shared across selected series, live overlap is reconciled without duplicate replay, and chart reduction occurs only after the complete logical persisted set is established.

CSV export is read-only and generated from persisted telemetry rather than chart/browser memory. It is organization-scoped through canonical node/equipment/channel/metric identity, deterministic, UTF-8, preserves null/invalid quality truthfully, respects the 31-day history bound and fails closed above 100,000 rows instead of truncating.

Final exact-head gates:

- Core CI `32220599757`: PASS;
- Telemetry Service `32220599759`: PASS;
- Authenticated Dashboard Acceptance `32220599864`: PASS;
- Offline Bundle `32220599751`: PASS;
- Acquisition Scale Acceptance `32220599830`: PASS;
- Container Supply Chain `32220599753`: PASS;
- all other triggered browser/fleet/capacity/DR gates: PASS.

No acquisition-registry mutation, physical polling cadence change, Modbus write, hardware write, migration, dependency upgrade or mandatory cloud runtime dependency was introduced.

## Issue #608 — complete CI reliability interrupt

Issue #608 is closed `status:done`. PR #609 merged GREEN as `3e13800f413eb2255b992b6ff9f3aec935acf602`. The blocking browser gates now use a preinstalled GitHub-runner Chrome executable and install only Playwright's ffmpeg artifact for retained failure video; they no longer invoke `playwright install --with-deps chromium` or live Ubuntu APT dependency installation.

Exact-head #609 gates on `6ee2919d784048bf737e6d6f67427a08be0a228d`:

- Authenticated Dashboard Acceptance `32237282110`: PASS;
- Refrigeration Browser Acceptance `32237282106`: PASS;
- Acquisition Scale Acceptance `32237282105`: PASS.

No application runtime, dependency version, database, acquisition, Modbus or hardware behavior changed.

## Issue #611 — complete browser-readiness reliability interrupt

Issue #611 is closed `status:done`. PR #612 merged GREEN as `57908efc7f27598f5a991e2a009aaab0f6b92676`. The terminal Live Data retry acceptance no longer treats an aged seed sample as proof of a live stream: it first proves exactly one routed WebSocket transport, publishes a fresh local telemetry sample, and only then asserts the truthful Live UI state. The Authenticated Dashboard workflow now also triggers whenever this acceptance file changes.

Exact-head #612 gates on `60bc5ac749abe52107d358b85e4302f29f6d46be`:

- Core CI `32242665739`: PASS;
- Authenticated Dashboard Acceptance `32242665728`: PASS;
- Refrigeration Browser Acceptance `32242665724`: PASS;
- Acquisition Scale Acceptance `32242665721`: PASS.

No product runtime, acquisition, database, dependency, Modbus or hardware behavior changed.

## Issue #588 — complete

Issue #588 is closed. PR #602 merged GREEN as `62e94ea02b2f4c7da03d1a5fa11cc1e24459f6f7` after the Energy history surface was migrated to the canonical NEXOLAB Chart System. The final implementation preserves persisted history and real gaps, adds adaptive date/time axes, unit-aware Y axes, exact pointer/keyboard inspection and deterministic visible-series handling without changing acquisition behavior.

Exact-head `0da49e2ac1037efab78367cf76e201ce5a5133a4` gates:

- Core CI `32246136302`: PASS;
- Refrigeration Browser Acceptance `32246136115`: PASS;
- Authenticated Dashboard Acceptance `32246136164`: PASS after rerun of an unrelated Equipment URL-filter timing failure;
- Offline Bundle `32246136097`: PASS.

Local Raspberry Pi worktree checks on the exact branch content also passed `format:check`, lint, typecheck and 18 focused chart/energy tests. The diff contains no package/lockfile, service, infrastructure, script or workflow changes. No acquisition mutation, Modbus write, hardware write, dependency upgrade or mandatory cloud runtime dependency was introduced.

## Issue #604 — implementation verified, PR pending

Issue #604 is implemented on `feat/604-equipment-workspace`. The measured organization-wide registry did **not** justify a new backend universal-asset endpoint: existing canonical repositories remain authoritative. The UI bottleneck was all-at-once chamber completion plus unbounded rendering.

The implementation now provides:

- progressive registry results while bounded chamber catalog loads continue;
- cancellation and partial-failure preservation without demo/fallback substitution;
- an 80-row bounded DOM page with sticky header and identity column;
- deterministic sorting, grouping and collapsible group risk counts;
- URL-backed search/filter/risk/group/sort state without remounting the registry data loader;
- locally persisted operator density and visible-column preferences only;
- non-blocking right-side read-only asset inspector with keyboard adjacent navigation;
- source-backed metrology sections that explicitly disclose fields the current contract does not store.

Local exact implementation commit `ad06911d` passed:

- `npm run format:check`;
- `npm run lint`;
- `npm run typecheck`;
- `npm test` — 113 test files / 513 tests PASS;
- `npm run build`;
- focused Equipment Registry production browser acceptance with large seeded inventory — PASS;
- acquisition-invariant browser acceptance — 3/3 PASS.

Browser evidence is under `runtime/evidence/issue-604-equipment-registry` and `runtime/evidence/issue-604-acquisition-invariant`. No dependency, backend schema, acquisition cadence, Modbus, hardware, runtime deployment or mandatory cloud dependency changed.

A pre-existing acceptance-runner defect discovered during verification was isolated as Issue #615: the default generated `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` contains uppercase timestamp characters rejected by current Docker Compose. #604 acceptance passed using an explicit valid lowercase project-name override; #615 is not a #604 product blocker.

## Current execution boundary

Current Work Package: **Issue #604 — Evolve Equipment Registry into a scalable operator workspace** — implementation and local verification complete; PR/CI pending.

Product Owner priority remains **#604 → #605 → #606**, followed by dual-RS-485 architecture **#607** before cadence/capacity #589 and Settings controls #590. After #604 merges GREEN, the next Ready candidate is #605; the planned sequence remains **#604 → #605 → #606 → #607 → #589 → #590**.

Issue #585 remains independently blocked on physical W2/Unit 201 handback. No second RS-485 adapter installation, wiring move or hardware cutover is authorized by this planning state.

## Safety boundaries

`LOCAL_LAN`, offline-first runtime and read-only industrial boundaries remain unchanged. No Modbus/controller write, hardware write, production/site cutover, persistent-data deletion, named-volume deletion, secret/billing/DNS mutation or mandatory cloud runtime dependency is authorized.
